<p></p>
<li><strong>Why is it important to configure a hostname on a device?</strong>
<ul>
<li>a Cisco router or switch only begins to operate when its hostname is set</li>
<li>a hostname must be configured before any other parameters</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to identify the device during remote access (SSH or telnet)*</strong></span></li>
<li>to allow local access to the device through the console port</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
It is important to configure a hostname because various authentication processes use the device hostname. Hostnames are helpful for documentation, and they identify the device during remote access.<br />
</p></div></li>

<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A banner message can be an important part of the legal process in the event that someone is prosecuted for breaking into a device. A banner message should make it clear that only authorized personnel should attempt to access the device. However, the banner command does not prevent unauthorized entry.<br />

<p></p>
<li><strong>While trying to solve a network issue, a technician made multiple changes to the current router configuration file. The changes did not solve the problem and were not saved. What action can the technician take to discard the changes and work with the file in NVRAM?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Issue the reload command without saving the running configuration.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Delete the vlan.dat file and reboot the device.</li>
<li>Close and reopen the terminal emulation software.</li>
<li>Issue the copy startup-config running-config command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The technician does not want to make any mistakes trying to remove all the changes that were done to the running configuration file. The solution is to reboot the router without saving the running configuration. The copy startup-config running-config command does not overwrite the running configuration file with the configuration file stored in NVRAM, but rather it just has an additive effect.<br />

<li><strong>Which statement is true about the running configuration file in a Cisco IOS device?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It affects the operation of the device immediately when modified.*</strong></span></li>
<li>It is stored in NVRAM.</li>
<li>It should be deleted using the erase running-config command.</li>
<li>It is automatically saved when the router reboots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
As soon as configuration commands are entered into a router, they modify the device immediately. Running configuration files can not be deleted nor are they saved automatically.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What are two characteristics of RAM on a Cisco device? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>RAM provides nonvolatile storage.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The configuration that is actively running on the device is stored in RAM. *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The contents of RAM are lost during a power cycle. *</strong></span></li>
<li>RAM is a component in Cisco switches but not in Cisco routers.</li>
<li>RAM is able to store multiple versions of IOS and configuration files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
RAM stores data that is used by the device to support network operations. The running configuration is stored in RAM. This type of memory is considered volatile memory because data is lost during a power cycle. Flash memory stores the IOS and delivers a copy of the IOS into RAM when a device is powered on. Flash memory is nonvolatile since it retains stored contents during a loss of power.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which interface allows remote management of a Layer 2 switch?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the AUX interface</li>
<li>the console port interface</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the switch virtual interface*</strong></span></li>
<li>the first Ethernet port interface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In a Layer 2 switch, there is a switch virtual interface (SVI) that provides a means for remotely managing the device.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which interface is the default SVI on a Cisco switch?</strong>
<ul>
<li>FastEthernet 0/1</li>
<li>GigabitEthernet 0/1</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>VLAN 1*</strong></span></li>
<li>VLAN 99</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
An SVI is a virtual interface and VLAN 1 is enabled by default on Cisco switches. VLAN 99 must be configured to be used. FastEthernet 0/1 and GigabitEthernet 0/1 are physical interfaces.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Why would a Layer 2 switch need an IP address?</strong>
<ul>
<li>to enable the switch to send broadcast frames to attached PCs</li>
<li>to enable the switch to function as a default gateway</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to enable the switch to be managed remotely*</strong></span></li>
<li>to enable the switch to receive frames from attached PCs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A switch, as a Layer 2 device, does not need an IP address to transmit frames to attached devices. However, when a switch is accessed remotely through the network, it must have a Layer 3 address. The IP address must be applied to a virtual interface rather than to a physical interface. Routers, not switches, function as default gateways.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What command can be used on a Windows PC to see the IP configuration of that computer?</strong>
<ul>
<li>ping</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ipconfig*</strong></span></li>
<li>show interfaces</li>
<li>show ip interface brief</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
On a Windows PC, the ipconfig command can be used to verify the current IP configuration. The ping command can be used to verify connectivity to other network devices. The show interfaces and show ip interface brief commands are both Cisco IOS commands that are used to see the status of router and switch interfaces.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A technician is adding a new PC to a LAN. After unpacking the components and making all the connections, the technician starts the PC. After the OS loads, the technician opens a browser, and verifies that the PC can reach the Internet. Why was the PC able to connect to the network with no additional configuration?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The PC does not require any additional information to function on the network.</li>
<li>The PC came preconfigured with IP addressing information from the factory.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The PC was preconfigured to use DHCP.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The PC used DNS to automatically receive IP addressing information from a server.</li>
<li>The PC virtual interface is compatible with any network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The new PC was preconfigured to use DHCP. When the PC is connected to a network that uses DHCP, it gets the IP address settings from the DHCP server that will allow it to function on the network. All devices require at least an IP address and subnet mask to function on a LAN. DNS does not automatically configure addresses on hosts. PC virtual interfaces are not universally compatible with LANs and do not necessarily provide a host with an IP address. At this place in the course, virtual interfaces are used on network switches.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is a user trying to determine when issuing a ping 10.1.1.1 command on a PC?</strong>
<ul>
<li>if the TCP/IP stack is functioning on the PC without putting traffic on the wire</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>if there is connectivity with the destination device*</strong></span></li>
<li>the path that traffic will take to reach the destination</li>
<li>what type of device is at the destination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The ping destination command can be used to test connectivity.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. A network technician is testing connectivity in a new network. Based on the test results shown in the exhibit, which device does the technician have connectivity with and which device does the technician not have connectivity with? (Choose two.)</strong><br />
<img src="https://ccnav6.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/i274052v1n3_274052.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>connectivity: switch 2*</strong></span></li>
<li>connectivity: PC-D</li>
<li>connectivity: PC-B</li>
<li>no connectivity: switch 1</li>
<li>no connectivity: switch 2</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>no connectivity: PC-C*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The exhibit shows ping tests to two devices. One device has the IP address of 192.168.1.2, which is switch 2. The other test is to the IP address of 192.168.1.21, which is host PC-C. For the first test, to switch 2, the results are successful, with four reply messages received. This means that connectivity exists to switch 2. For the second test, all four messages timed out. This indicates that connectivity does not exist to PC-C.<br />

<strong>Refer to the exhibit. What three facts can be determined from the viewable output of the show ip interface brief command? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two physical interfaces have been configured.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The switch can be remotely managed.*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>One device is attached to a physical interface.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Passwords have been configured on the switch.</li>
<li>Two devices are attached to the switch.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The default SVI has been configured.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Vlan1 is the default SVI. Because an SVI has been configured, the switch can be configured and managed remotely. FastEthernet0/0 is showing up and up, so a device is connected.<br />

<li><strong>What method can be used by two computers to ensure that packets are not dropped because too much data is being sent too quickly?</strong>
<ul>
<li>encapsulation</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>flow control*</strong></span></li>
<li>access method</li>
<li>response timeout</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In order for two computers to be able to communicate effectively, there must be a mechanism that allows both the source and destination to set the timing of the transmission and receipt of data. Flow control allows for this by ensuring that data is not sent too fast for it to be received properly.</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What type of communication will send a message to all devices on a local area network?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>broadcast*</strong></span></li>
<li>multicast</li>
<li>unicast</li>
<li>allcast</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong>Broadcast communication is a one-to-all communication. A unicast communication is a one-to-one communication. Multicast is a one-to-many communication where the message is delivered to a specific group of hosts. Allcast is not a standard term to describe message delivery.</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What process is used to place one message inside another message for transfer from the source to the destination?</strong>
<ul>
<li>access control</li>
<li>decoding</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>encapsulation*</strong></span></li>
<li>flow control</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong>Encapsulation is the process of placing one message format into another message format. An example is how a packet is placed in its entirety into the data field as it is encapsulated into a frame.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>A web client is sending a request for a webpage to a web server. From the perspective of the client, what is the correct order of the protocol stack that is used to prepare the request for transmission?</strong>
<ul>
<li>HTTP, IP, TCP, Ethernet</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>HTTP, TCP, IP, Ethernet*</strong></span></li>
<li>Ethernet, TCP, IP, HTTP</li>
<li>Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
1. HTTP governs the way that a web server and client interact.<br />
2. TCP manages individual conversations between web servers and clients.<br />
3. IP is responsible for delivery across the best path to the destination.<br />
4. Ethernet takes the packet from IP and formats it for transmission.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which statement is correct about network protocols?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Network protocols define the type of hardware that is used and how it is mounted in racks.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They define how messages are exchanged between the source and the destination.*</strong></span></li>
<li>They all function in the network access layer of TCP/IP.</li>
<li>They are only required for exchange of messages between devices on remote networks.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Network protocols are implemented in hardware, or software, or both. They interact with each other within different layers of a protocol stack. Protocols have nothing to do with the installation of the network equipment. Network protocols are required to exchange information between source and destination devices in both local and remote networks.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which statement is true about the TCP/IP and OSI models?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The TCP/IP transport layer and OSI Layer 4 provide similar services and functions.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The TCP/IP network access layer has similar functions to the OSI network layer.</li>
<li>The OSI Layer 7 and the TCP/IP application layer provide identical functions.</li>
<li>The first three OSI layers describe general services that are also provided by the TCP/IP internet layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
he TCP/IP internet layer provides the same function as the OSI network layer. The transport layer of both the TCP/IP and OSI models provides the same function. The TCP/IP application layer includes the same functions as OSI Layers 5, 6, and 7.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is an advantage of using standards to develop and implement protocols?</strong>
<ul>
<li>A particular protocol can only be implemented by one manufacturer.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Products from different manufacturers can interoperate successfully.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Different manufacturers are free to apply different requirements when implementing a protocol.</li>
<li>Standards provide flexibility for manufacturers to create devices that comply with unique requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Standards-based protocols enable products from different manufacturers to interoperate successfully. Standards-based protocols enable many manufacturers to implement that protocol. If different manufacturers implement different requirements within the same protocol, then their products will not be interoperable.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What three application layer protocols are part of the TCP/IP protocol suite? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>ARP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DHCP *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DNS *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>FTP*</strong></span></li>
<li>NAT</li>
<li>PPP</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
DNS, DHCP, and FTP are all application layer protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite. ARP and PPP are network access layer protocols, and NAT is an internet layer protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What are proprietary protocols?</strong>
<ul>
<li>protocols developed by private organizations to operate on any vendor hardware</li>
<li>protocols that can be freely used by any organization or vendor</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>protocols developed by organizations who have control over their definition and operation*</strong></span></li>
<li>a collection of protocols known as the TCP/IP protocol suite</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Proprietary protocols have their definition and operation controlled by one company or vendor. Some of them can be used by different organizations with permission from the owner. The TCP/IP protocol suite is an open standard, not a proprietary protocol.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is an advantage of network devices using open standard protocols?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Network communications is confined to data transfers between devices from the same vendor.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A client host and a server running different operating systems can successfully exchange data.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Internet access can be controlled by a single ISP in each market.</li>
<li>Competition and innovation are limited to specific types of products.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
An advantage of network devices implementing open standard protocols, such as from the TCP/IP suite, is that clients and servers running different operating systems can communicate with each other. Open standard protocols facilitate innovation and competition between vendors and across markets, and can reduce the occurrence of monopolies in networking markets.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. If Host1 were to transfer a file to the server, what layers of the TCP/IP model would be used?</strong><br />

<li>only application, transport, network, data link, and physical layers</li>
<li>application, session, transport, network, data link, and physical layers</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The TCP/IP model contains the application, transport, internet, and network access layers. A file transfer uses the FTP application layer protocol. The data would move from the application layer through all of the layers of the model and across the network to the file server.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which three layers of the OSI model are comparable in function to the application layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> application *</strong></span></li>

<li>transport</li>
<li>data link</li>
<li>physical</li>
<li>network</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: application, transport, internet, and network access. The OSI model consists of seven layers: application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical. The top three layers of the OSI model: application, presentation, and session map to the application layer of the TCP/IP model.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>At which layer of the OSI model would a logical address be encapsulated?</strong>
<ul>
<li>physical layer</li>
<li>data link layer</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>network layer*</strong></span></li>
<li>transport layer</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Logical addresses, also known as IP addresses, are encapsulated at the network layer. Physical addresses are encapsulated at the data link layer. Port addresses are encapsulated at the transport layer. No addresses are encapsulated at the physical layer.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>At which layer of the OSI model would a logical address be added during encapsulation??</strong>
<ul>
<li>physical layer</li>
<li>data link layer</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>network layer*</strong></span></li>
<li>transport layer</li>

<li><strong>Which PDU format is used when bits are received from the network medium by the NIC of a host?</strong>
<ul>
<li>file</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>frame*</strong></span></li>
<li>packet</li>
<li>segment</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When received at the physical layer of a host, the bits are formatted into a frame at the data link layer. A packet is the PDU at the network layer. A segment is the PDU at the transport layer. A file is a data structure that may be used at the application layer.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which PDU is processed when a host computer is de-encapsulating a message at the transport layer of the TCP/IP model?</strong>
<ul>

<li>A frame with the destination MAC address of ServerB.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In order to send data to ServerB, HostA will generate a packet that contains the IP address of the destination device on the remote network and a frame that contains the MAC address of the default gateway device on the local network.</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which address does a NIC use when deciding whether to accept a frame?</strong>
<ul>
<li>source IP address</li>
<li>source MAC address</li>
<li>destination IP address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>destination MAC address*</strong></span></li>
<li>source Ethernet address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What will happen if the default gateway address is incorrectly configured on a host?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The host cannot communicate with other hosts in the local network.</li>
<li>The switch will not forward packets initiated by the host.</li>
<li>The host will have to use ARP to determine the correct address of the default gateway.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks.*</strong></span></li>
<li>A ping from the host to 127.0.0.1 would not be successful.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a host needs to send a message to another host located on the same network, it can forward the message directly. However, when a host needs to send a message to a remote network, it must use the router, also known as the default gateway. This is because the data link frame address of the remote destination host cannot be used directly. Instead, the IP packet has to be sent to the router (default gateway) and the router will forward the packet toward its destination. Therefore, if the default gateway is incorrectly configured, the host can communicate with other hosts on the same network, but not with hosts on remote networks.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which characteristic describes the default gateway of a host computer?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the logical address of the router interface on the same network as the host computer*</strong></span></li>
<li>the physical address of the switch interface connected to the host computer</li>
<li>the physical address of the router interface on the same network as the host computer</li>
<li>the logical address assigned to the switch interface connected to the router</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The default gateway is the IP address of an interface on the router on the same network as the sending host.<br />

<li><strong>What are two reasons for physical layer protocols to use frame encoding techniques? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>to reduce the number of collisions on the media</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to distinguish data bits from control bits*</strong></span></li>
<li>to provide better media error correction</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to identify where the frame starts and ends*</strong></span></li>
<li>to increase the media throughput</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to distinguish data from control information*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
An encoding technique converts a stream of data bits in a predefined code that can be recognized by both the transmitter and the receiver. Using predefined patterns helps to differentiate data bits from control bits and provide better media error detection.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is indicated by the term throughput?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the guaranteed data transfer rate offered by an ISP</li>
<li>the capacity of a particular medium to carry data</li>
<li>the measure of the usable data transferred across the media</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the measure of the bits transferred across the media over a given period of time*</strong></span></li>
<li>the time it takes for a message to get from sender to receiver</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. Throughput is affected by a number of factors such as, EMI and latency, so it rarely matches the specified bandwidth for a network medium. The throughput measurement includes user data bits and other data bits, such as overhead, acknowledging, and encapsulation. The measure of the usable data transferred across the media is called goodput.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>A network administrator notices that some newly installed Ethernet cabling is carrying corrupt and distorted data signals. The new cabling was installed in the ceiling close to fluorescent lights and electrical equipment. Which two factors may interfere with the copper cabling and result in signal distortion and data corruption? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>EMI*</strong></span></li>
<li>crosstalk</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>RFI*</strong></span></li>
<li>signal attenuation</li>
<li>extended length of cabling</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
EMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt data signals that are carried by copper media. These distortions usually come from radio waves and electromagnetic devices such as motors and florescent lights. Crosstalk is a disturbance that is caused by adjacent wires bundled too close together with the magnetic field of one wire affecting another. Signal attenuation is caused when an electrical signal begins to deteriorate over the length of a copper cable.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which characteristic describes crosstalk?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the distortion of the network signal from fluorescent lighting</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the distortion of the transmitted messages from signals carried in adjacent wires*</strong></span></li>
<li>the weakening of the network signal over long cable lengths</li>
<li>the loss of wireless signal over excessive distance from the access point</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
EMI and RFI can distort network signals because of interference from fluorescent lights or electric motors. Attenuation results in deterioration of the network signal as it travels along copper cabling. Wireless devices can experience loss of signals because of excessive distances from a access point, but this is not crosstalk. Crosstalk is the disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of the signal carried on an adjacent wire within the same cable.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What technique is used with UTP cable to help protect against signal interference from crosstalk?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>twisting the wires together into pairs*</strong></span></li>
<li>wrapping a foil shield around the wire pairs</li>
<li>encasing the cables within a flexible plastic sheath</li>
<li>terminating the cable with special grounded connectors</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
To help prevent the effects of crosstalk, UTP cable wires are twisted together into pairs. Twisting the wires together causes the magnetic fields of each wire to cancel each other out.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. The PC is connected to the console port of the switch. All the other connections are made through FastEthernet links. Which types of UTP cables can be used to connect the devices?</strong><br />

<li>1 – crossover, 2 – straight-through, 3 – rollover</li>
<li>1 – crossover, 2 – rollover, 3 – straight-through</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A straight-through cable is commonly used to interconnect a host to a switch and a switch to a router. A crossover cable is used to interconnect similar devices together like switch to a switch, a host to a host, or a router to a router. If a switch has the MDIX capability, a crossover could be used to connect the switch to the router; however, that option is not available. A rollover cable is used to connect to a router or switch console port.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. What is wrong with the displayed termination?</strong><br />
<img src="https://ccnav6.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/i274300v1n1_209630.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The woven copper braid should not have been removed.</li>
<li>The wrong type of connector is being used.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The untwisted length of each wire is too long.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The wires are too thick for the connector that is used.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a cable to an RJ-45 connector is terminated, it is important to ensure that the untwisted wires are not too long and that the flexible plastic sheath surrounding the wires is crimped down and not the bare wires. None of the colored wires should be visible from the bottom of the jack.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which type of connector does a network interface card use?</strong>
<ul>
<li>DIN</li>
<li>PS-2</li>
<li>RJ-11</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>RJ-45*</strong></span></li>

</li>
<li><strong>What is one advantage of using fiber optic cabling rather than copper cabling?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is usually cheaper than copper cabling.</li>
<li>It is able to be installed around sharp bends.</li>
<li>It is easier to terminate and install than copper cabling.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is able to carry signals much farther than copper cabling.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Copper cabling is usually cheaper and easier to install than fiber optic cabling. However, fiber cables generally have a much greater signaling range than copper.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Why are two strands of fiber used for a single fiber optic connection?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The two strands allow the data to travel for longer distances without degrading.</li>
<li>They prevent crosstalk from causing interference on the connection.</li>
<li>They increase the speed at which the data can travel.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They allow for full-duplex connectivity.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Light can only travel in one direction down a single strand of fiber. In order to allow for full-duplex communication two strands of fiber must be connected between each device.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>A network administrator is designing the layout of a new wireless network. Which three areas of concern should be accounted for when building a wireless network? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>mobility options</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>security *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>interference *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>coverage area*</strong></span></li>
<li>extensive cabling</li>
<li>packet collision</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The three areas of concern for wireless networks focus on the size of the coverage area, any nearby interference, and providing network security. Extensive cabling is not a concern for wireless networks, as a wireless network will require minimal cabling for providing wireless access to hosts. Mobility options are not a component of the areas of concern for wireless networks.<br />

<li><strong>Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for specifying the encapsulation method used for specific types of media?</strong>
<ul>
<li>application</li>
<li>transport</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>data link*</strong></span></li>
<li>physical</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Encapsulation is a function of the data link layer. Different media types require different data link layer encapsulation.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What are two services performed by the data link layer of the OSI model? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>It encrypts data packets.</li>
<li>It determines the path to forward packets.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It accepts Layer 3 packets and encapsulates them into frames. *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It provides media access control and performs error detection.*</strong></span></li>
<li>It monitors the Layer 2 communication by building a MAC address table.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The data link layer is responsible for the exchange of frames between nodes over a physical network media. Specifically the data link layer performs two basic services:<br />
It accepts Layer 3 packets and encapsulates them into frames.<br />
It provides media access control and performs error detection.<br />
Path determination is a service provided at Layer 3. A Layer 2 switch builds a MAC address table as part of its operation, but path determination is not the service that is provided by the data link layer.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is true concerning physical and logical topologies?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The logical topology is always the same as the physical topology.</li>
<li>Physical topologies are concerned with how a network transfers frames.</li>
<li>Physical topologies display the IP addressing scheme of each network.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Logical topologies refer to how a network transfers data between devices.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Physical topologies show the physical interconnection of devices. Logical topologies show the way the network will transfer data between connected nodes.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which method of data transfer allows information to be sent and received at the same time?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> full duplex*</strong></span></li>

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>End devices connect to a central intermediate device, which in turn connects to other central intermediate devices.*</strong></span></li>
<li>End devices are connected together by a bus and each bus connects to a central intermediate device.</li>
<li>Each end system is connected to its respective neighbor via an intermediate device.</li>
<li>All end and intermediate devices are connected in a chain to each other.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In an extended star topology, central intermediate devices interconnect other star topologies.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. Which statement describes the media access control methods that are used by the networks in the exhibit?</strong><br />

<ul>
<li>All three networks use CSMA/CA</li>
<li>None of the networks require media access control.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Network 1 uses CSMA/CD and Network 3 uses CSMA/CA.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Network 1 uses CSMA/CA and Network 2 uses CSMA/CD.</li>
<li>Network 2 uses CSMA/CA and Network 3 uses CSMA/CD.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Network 1 represents an Ethernet LAN. Data on the wired LAN accesses the media using CSMA/CD. Network 2 represents a point-to-point WAN connection so no media access method is required. Network 3 represents a WLAN and data accesses the network using CSMA/CA.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is contained in the trailer of a data-link frame?</strong>
<ul>
<li>logical address</li>
<li>physical address</li>
<li>data</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>error detection*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The trailer in a data-link frame contains error detection information that is pertinent to the frame included in the FCS field. The header contains control information, such as the addressing, while the area that is indicated by the word &#8220;data&#8221; includes the data, transport layer PDU, and the IP header.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>As data travels on the media in a stream of 1s and 0s how does a receiving node identify the beginning and end of a frame?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The transmitting node inserts start and stop bits into the frame.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The transmitting node sends a beacon to notify that a data frame is attached.</li>
<li>The receiving node identifies the beginning of a frame by seeing a physical address.</li>
<li>The transmitting node sends an out-of-band signal to the receiver about the beginning of the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When data travels on the media, it is converted into a stream of 1s and 0s. The framing process inserts into the frame start and stop indicator flags so that the destination can detect the beginning and end of the frame.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is a role of the Logical Link Control sublayer?</strong>
<ul>
<li>to provide data link layer addressing</li>

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to mark frames to identify the network layer protocol being carried*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong>There are two data link sublayers, MAC and LLC. The LLC sublayer is responsible for communicating with the network layer and for tagging frames to identify what Layer 3 protocol is encapsulated.</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is the definition of bandwidth?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time</li>

<li>to verify the physical address in the frame</li>
<li>to verify the logical address in the frame</li>
<li>to compute the checksum header for the data field in the frame</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The CRC value in the FCS field of the received frame is compared to the computed CRC value of that frame, in order to verify the integrity of the frame. If the two values do not match, then the frame is discarded.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Fill in the blank.</strong><br />
The term <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>bandwidth </strong></span>indicates the capacity of a medium to carry data and it is typically measured in kilobits per second (kb/s) or megabits per second (Mb/s).<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />

<li><strong>What happens to runt frames received by a Cisco Ethernet switch?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The frame is dropped.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The frame is returned to the originating network device.</li>
<li>The frame is broadcast to all other devices on the same network.</li>
<li>The frame is sent to the default gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In an attempt to conserve bandwidth and not forward useless frames, Ethernet devices drop frames that are considered to be runt (less than 64 bytes) or jumbo (greater than 1500 bytes) frames.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What are the two sizes (minimum and maximum) of an Ethernet frame? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>56 bytes</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>64 bytes*</strong></span></li>
<li>128 bytes</li>
<li>1024 bytes</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1518 bytes*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The minimum Ethernet frame is 64 bytes. The maximum Ethernet frame is 1518 bytes. A network technician must know the minimum and maximum frame size in order to recognize runt and jumbo frames.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What statement describes Ethernet?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It defines the most common LAN type in the world.*</strong></span></li>
<li>It is the required Layer 1 and 2 standard for Internet communication.</li>
<li>It defines a standard model used to describe how networking works.</li>
<li>It connects multiple sites such as routers located in different countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Ethernet is the most common LAN protocol in the world. It operates at Layer 1 and 2, but is not required for Internet communication. The OSI model is used to describe how networks operate. A WAN connects multiple sites located in different countries.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which two statements describe features or functions of the logical link control sublayer in Ethernet standards? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> Logical link control is implemented in software.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Logical link control is specified in the IEEE 802.3 standard.</li>
<li>The LLC sublayer adds a header and a trailer to the data.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The data link layer uses LLC to communicate with the upper layers of the protocol suite.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The LLC sublayer is responsible for the placement and retrieval of frames on and off the media.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Logical link control is implemented in software and enables the data link layer to communicate with the upper layers of the protocol suite. Logical link control is specified in the IEEE 802.2 standard. IEEE 802.3 is a suite of standards that define the different Ethernet types. The MAC (Media Access Control) sublayer is responsible for the placement and retrieval of frames on and off the media. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for adding a header and a trailer to the network layer protocol data unit (PDU).<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What statement describes a characteristic of MAC addresses?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They must be globally unique.*</strong></span></li>
<li>They are only routable within the private network.</li>
<li>They are added as part of a Layer 3 PDU.</li>
<li>They have a 32-bit binary value.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Any vendor selling Ethernet devices must register with the IEEE to ensure the vendor is assigned a unique 24-bit code, which becomes the first 24 bits of the MAC address. The last 24 bits of the MAC address are generated per hardware device. This helps to ensure globally unique addresses for each Ethernet device.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which statement is true about MAC addresses?</strong>
<ul>
<li>MAC addresses are implemented by software.</li>
<li>A NIC only needs a MAC address if connected to a WAN.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The first three bytes are used by the vendor assigned OUI.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The ISO is responsible for MAC addresses regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A MAC address is composed of 6 bytes. The first 3 bytes are used for vendor identification and the last 3 bytes must be assigned a unique value within the same OUI. MAC addresses are implemented in hardware. A NIC needs a MAC address to communicate over the LAN. The IEEE regulates the MAC addresses.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which destination address is used in an ARP request frame?</strong>
<ul>
<li>0.0.0.0</li>
<li>255.255.255.255</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>FFFF.FFFF.FFFF*</strong></span></li>
<li>127.0.0.1</li>
<li>01-00-5E-00-AA-23</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The purpose of an ARP request is to find the MAC address of the destination host on an Ethernet LAN. The ARP process sends a Layer 2 broadcast to all devices on the Ethernet LAN. The frame contains the IP address of the destination and the broadcast MAC address, FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What addressing information is recorded by a switch to build its MAC address table?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the destination Layer 3 address of incoming packets</li>
<li>the destination Layer 2 address of outgoing frames</li>
<li>the source Layer 3 address of outgoing packets</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the source Layer 2 address of incoming frames*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A switch builds a MAC address table by inspecting incoming Layer 2 frames and recording the source MAC address found in the frame header. The discovered and recorded MAC address is then associated with the port used to receive the frame.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. The exhibit shows a small switched network and the contents of the MAC address table of the switch. PC1 has sent a frame addressed to PC3. What will the switch do with the frame?</strong><br />
<img src="https://ccnav6.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/i275394v1n1_207267.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The switch will discard the frame.</li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame only to port 2.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The switch will forward the frame to all ports except port 4.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame to all ports.</li>
<li>The switch will forward the frame only to ports 1 and 3.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The MAC address of PC3 is not present in the MAC table of the switch. Because the switch does not know where to send the frame that is addressed to PC3, it will forward the frame to all the switch ports, except for port 4, which is the incoming port.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which switching method uses the CRC value in a frame?</strong>
<ul>
<li>cut-through</li>
<li>fast-forward</li>
<li>fragment-free</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>store-and-forward*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When the store-and-forward switching method is used, the switch receives the complete frame before forwarding it on to the destination. The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) part of the trailer is used to determine if the frame has been modified during transit.​​ In contrast, a cut-through switch forwards the frame once the destination Layer 2 address is read. Two types of cut-through switching methods are fast-forward and fragment-free.<br />

<li><strong>What is auto-MDIX?</strong>
<ul>
<li>a type of Cisco switch</li>
<li>an Ethernet connector type</li>

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a feature that detects Ethernet cable type*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Auto-MDIX is a feature that is enabled on the latest Cisco switches and that allows the switch to detect and use whatever type of cable is attached to a specific port.​​<br />

<li>RT1 will send an ARP reply with its Fa0/0 MAC address.</li>
<li>RT1 will send an ARP reply with the PC2 MAC address.</li>
<li>SW1 will send an ARP reply with the PC2 MAC address.</li>
<li>SW1 will send an ARP reply with its Fa0/1 MAC address.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a network device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it sends a broadcast ARP request. In this case, the request will contain the IP address of PC2. The destination device (PC2) sends an ARP reply with its MAC address.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the aim of an ARP spoofing attack?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to associate IP addresses to the wrong MAC address*</strong></span></li>
<li>to overwhelm network hosts with ARP requests</li>
<li>to flood the network with ARP reply broadcasts</li>
<li>to fill switch MAC address tables with bogus addresses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is a characteristic of port-based memory buffering?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Frames in the memory buffer are dynamically linked to destination ports.</li>
<li>All frames are stored in a common memory buffer.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Frames are buffered in queues linked to specific ports.*</strong></span></li>
<li>All ports on a switch share a single memory buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong>Buffering is a technique used by Ethernet switches to store frames until they can be transmitted. With port-based buffering, frames are stored in queues that are linked to specific incoming and outgoing ports.</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the minimum Ethernet frame size that will not be discarded by the receiver as a runt frame?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>64 bytes*</strong></span></li>
<li>512 bytes</li>
<li>1024 bytes</li>
<li>1500 bytes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What are two potential network problems that can result from ARP operation? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Manually configuring static ARP associations could facilitate ARP poisoning or MAC address spoofing.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>On large networks with low bandwidth, multiple ARP broadcasts could cause data communication delays. *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Network attackers could manipulate MAC address and IP address mappings in ARP messages with the intent of intercepting network traffic.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Large numbers of ARP request broadcasts could cause the host MAC address table to overflow and prevent the host from communicating on the network.</li>
<li>Multiple ARP replies result in the switch MAC address table containing entries that match the MAC addresses of hosts that are connected to the relevant switch port.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Large numbers of ARP broadcast messages could cause momentary data communications delays. Network attackers could manipulate MAC address and IP address mappings in ARP messages with the intent to intercept network traffic. ARP requests and replies cause entries to be made into the ARP table, not the MAC address table. ARP table overflows are very unlikely. Manually configuring static ARP associations is a way to prevent, not facilitate, ARP poisoning and MAC address spoofing. Multiple ARP replies resulting in the switch MAC address table containing entries that match the MAC addresses of connected nodes and are associated with the relevant switch port are required for normal switch frame forwarding operations. It is not an ARP caused network problem.<br />

<li><strong>Which statement describes the treatment of ARP requests on the local link?</strong><br />
They must be forwarded by all routers on the local network.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They are received and processed by every device on the local network.*</strong></span><br />
They are dropped by all switches on the local network.<br />

<strong>The switches are in their default configuration. Host A needs to communicate with host D, but host A does not have the MAC address for its default gateway. Which network hosts will receive the ARP request sent by host A?</strong><br />
only host D<br />
only router R1<br />
only hosts A, B, and C<br />
only hosts A, B, C, and D<br />
only hosts B and C<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>only hosts B, C, and router R1*</strong></span><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Since host A does not have the MAC address of the default gateway in its ARP table, host A sends an ARP broadcast. The ARP broadcast would be sent to every device on the local network. Hosts B, C, and router R1 would receive the broadcast. Router R1 would not forward the message.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit.</strong><br />

<strong>A switch with a default configuration connects four hosts. The ARP table for host A is shown. What happens when host A wants to send an IP packet to host D?</strong>Host A sends an ARP request to the MAC address of host D.<br />
Host D sends an ARP request to host A.<br />
Host A sends out the packet to the switch. The switch sends the packet only to the host D, which in turn responds.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Host A sends out a broadcast of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Every other host connected to the switch receives the broadcast and host D responds with its MAC address.*</strong></span><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Whenever the destination MAC address is not contained within the ARP table of the originating host, the host (host A in this example) will send a Layer 2 broadcast that has a destination MAC address of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices on the same network receive this broadcast. Host D will respond to this broadcast.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>True or False?</strong><br />
<strong>When a device is sending data to another device on a remote network, the Ethernet frame is sent to the MAC address of the default gateway.</strong><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>true*</strong></span><br />
false<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A MAC address is only useful on the local Ethernet network. When data is destined for a remote network of any type, the data is sent to the default gateway device, the Layer 3 device that routes for the local network.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>The ARP table in a switch maps which two types of address together?</strong><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Layer 3 address to a Layer 2 address*</strong></span><br />
Layer 3 address to a Layer 4 address<br />
Layer 4 address to a Layer 2 address<br />
Layer 2 address to a Layer 4 address<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The switch ARP table keeps a mapping of Layer 2 MAC addresses to Layer 3 IP addresses. These mappings can be learned by the switch dynamically through ARP or statically through manual configuration.<br />

A store-and-forward switch always stores the entire frame before forwarding, and checks its CRC and frame length. A cut-through switch can forward frames before receiving the destination address field, thus presenting less latency than a store-and-forward switch. Because the frame can begin to be forwarded before it is completely received, the switch may transmit a corrupt or runt frame. All forwarding methods require a Layer 2 switch to forward broadcast frames.<br />

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the ability to operate without regard to the data that is carried in each packet*</strong></span></li>
<li>the ability to manage the data transport between processes running on hosts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The function of the network layer protocols specifies the packet structure and processing used to carry the data from one host to another host. The actual communication data is encapsulated in the network layer PDU. The feature of its operation without regard to the data carried in each packet allows the network layer to carry packets for multiple types of communications.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What are two characteristics of IP? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>does not require a dedicated end-to-end connection *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>operates independently of the network media*</strong></span></li>
<li>retransmits packets if errors occur</li>
<li>re-assembles out of order packets into the correct order at the receiver end</li>
<li>guarantees delivery of packets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a connectionless, best effort protocol. This means that IP requires no end-to-end connection nor does it guarantee delivery of packets. IP is also media independent, which means it operates independently of the network media carrying the packets.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>When a connectionless protocol is in use at a lower layer of the OSI model, how is missing data detected and retransmitted if necessary?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Connectionless acknowledgements are used to request retransmission.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Upper-layer connection-oriented protocols keep track of the data received and can request retransmission from the upper-level protocols on the sending host.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Network layer IP protocols manage the communication sessions if connection-oriented transport services are not available.</li>
<li>The best-effort delivery process guarantees that all packets that are sent are received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When connectionless protocols are in use at a lower layer of the OSI model, upper-level protocols may need to work together on the sending and receiving hosts to account for and retransmit lost data. In some cases, this is not necessary, because for some applications a certain amount of data loss is tolerable.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which field in the IPv4 header is used to prevent a packet from traversing a network endlessly?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Time-to-Live*</strong></span></li>
<li>Sequence Number</li>
<li>Acknowledgment Number</li>
<li>Differentiated Services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The value of the Time-to-Live (TTL) field in the IPv4 header is used to limit the lifetime of a packet. The sending host sets the initial TTL value; which is decreased by one each time the packet is processed by a router. If the TTL field decrements to zero, the router discards the packet and sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Time Exceeded message to the source IP address. The Differentiated Services (DS) field is used to determine the priority of each packet. Sequence Number and Acknowledgment Number are two fields in the TCP header.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What IPv4 header field identifies the upper layer protocol carried in the packet?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Protocol*</strong></span></li>
<li>Identification</li>
<li>Version</li>
<li>Differentiated Services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
It is the Protocol field in the IP header that identifies the upper-layer protocol the packet is carrying. The Version field identifies the IP version. The Differential Services field is used for setting packet priority. The Identification field is used to reorder fragmented packets.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is one advantage that the IPv6 simplified header offers over IPv4?</strong>
<ul>
<li>smaller-sized header</li>
<li>little requirement for processing checksums</li>
<li>smaller-sized source and destination IP addresses</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>efficient packet handling*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The IPv6 simplified header offers several advantages over IPv4:<br />
· Better routing efficiency and efficient packet handling for performance and forwarding-rate scalability<br />
· No requirement for processing checksums<br />
· Simplified and more efficient extension header mechanisms (as opposed to the IPv4 Options field)<br />
· A Flow Label field for per-flow processing with no need to open the transport inner packet to identify the various traffic flows<br />

<li>C and L source routes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Routing table entries for remote routes will have a next hop IP address. The next hop IP address is the address of the router interface of the next device to be used to reach the destination network. Directly-connected and local routes have no next hop, because they do not require going through another router to be reached.<br />

<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which statement describes a hardware feature of a Cisco 1941 router that has the default hardware configuration?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It does not have an AUX port.</li>
<li>It has three FastEthernet interfaces for LAN access.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It has two types of ports that can be used to access the console.*</strong></span></li>
<li>It does not require a CPU because it relies on Compact Flash to run the IOS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The connections in a Cisco 1941 router include two types of ports that are used for initial configuration and command-line interface management access. The two ports are the regular RJ-45 port and a new USB Type-B (mini-B USB) connector. In addition, the router has an AUX port for remote management access, and two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces for LAN access. Compact Flash can be used increase device storage, but it does not perform the functions of the CPU, which is required for operation of the device.<br />

<li><strong>Why is NAT not needed in IPv6?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Because IPv6 has integrated security, there is no need to hide the IPv6 addresses of internal networks.?</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Any host or user can get a public IPv6 network address because the number of available IPv6 addresses is extremely large.?*</strong></span></li>
<li>The problems that are induced by NAT applications are solved because the IPv6 header improves packet handling by intermediate routers.?</li>
<li>The end-to-end connectivity problems that are caused by NAT are solved because the number of routes increases with the number of nodes that are connected to the Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is a service provided by the Flow Label field of the IPv6 header?</strong>
<ul>

<li><strong>What does the IP address 172.17.4.250/24 represent?</strong>
<ul>
<li>network address</li>
<li>multicast address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>host address*</strong></span></li>
<li>broadcast address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The /24 shows that the network address is 172.17.4.0. The broadcast address for this network would be 172.17.4.255. Useable host addresses for this network are 172.17.4.1 through 172.17.4.254.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the purpose of the subnet mask in conjunction with an IP address?</strong>
<ul>
<li>to uniquely identify a host on a network</li>
<li>to identify whether the address is public or private</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to determine the subnet to which the host belongs*</strong></span></li>
<li>to mask the IP address to outsiders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
With the IPv4 address, a subnet mask is also necessary. A subnet mask is a special type of IPv4 address that coupled with the IP address determines the subnet of which the device is a member. ​<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What subnet mask is represented by the slash notation /20?</strong>
<ul>
<li>255.255.255.248</li>
<li>255.255.224.0</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>255.255.240.0*</strong></span></li>
<li>255.255.255.0</li>
<li>255.255.255.192</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The slash notation /20 represents a subnet mask with 20 1s. This would translate to: 11111111.11111111.11110000.0000, which in turn would convert into 255.255.240.0.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A message is sent to all hosts on a remote network. Which type of message is it?</strong>
<ul>
<li>limited broadcast</li>
<li>multicast</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>directed broadcast*</strong></span></li>
<li>unicast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A directed broadcast is a message sent to all hosts on a specific network. It is useful for sending a broadcast to all hosts on a nonlocal network. A multicast message is a message sent to a selected group of hosts that are part of a subscribing multicast group. A limited broadcast is used for a communication that is limited to the hosts on the local network. A unicast message is a message sent from one host to another.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What are three characteristics of multicast transmission? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>The source address of a multicast transmission is in the range of 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A single packet can be sent to a group of hosts. *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Multicast transmission can be used by routers to exchange routing information. *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The range of 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 is reserved to reach multicast groups on a local network.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Computers use multicast transmission to request IPv4 addresses.</li>
<li>Multicast messages map lower layer addresses to upper layer addresses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Broadcast messages consist of single packets that are sent to all hosts on a network segment. These types of messages are used to request IPv4 addresses, and map upper layer addresses to lower layer addresses. A multicast transmission is a single packet sent to a group of hosts and is used by routing protocols, such as OSPF and RIPv2, to exchange routes. The address range 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 is reserved for link-local addresses to reach multicast groups on a local network.<br />

<p></p>
<li><strong>Which three IP addresses are private ? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>10.1.1.1*</strong></span></li>
<li>172.32.5.2</li>
<li>192.167.10.10</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>172.16.4.4 *</strong></span></li>

<li>224.6.6.6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The private IP addresses are within these three ranges:<br />
10.0.0.0 &#8211; 10.255.255.255<br />
172.16.0.0 &#8211; 172.31.255.255<br />
192.168.0.0 &#8211; 192.168.255.255<br />

<li><strong>Which two IPv4 to IPv6 transition techniques manage the interconnection of IPv6 domains? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>trunking</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>dual stack*</strong></span></li>
<li>encapsulation</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>tunneling*</strong></span></li>
<li>multiplexing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
There are three techniques to allow IPv4 and IPv6 to co-exist on a network. Dual stack allows IPv4 and IPv6 to coexist on the same network segment. Dual stack devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks simultaneously. Tunneling is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet, similar to other types of data. Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) allows IPv6-enabled devices to communicate with IPv4-enabled devices using a translation technique similar to NAT for IPv4<br />

<li><strong>What type of address is automatically assigned to an interface when IPv6 is enabled on that interface?</strong>
<ul>
<li>global unicast</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>link-local*</strong></span></li>
<li>loopback</li>
<li>unique local</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When IPv6 is enabled on any interface, that interface will automatically generate an IPv6 link-local address.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What are two types of IPv6 unicast addresses? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>multicast</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>loopback*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>link-local*</strong></span></li>
<li>anycast</li>
<li>broadcast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Multicast, anycast, and unicast are types of IPv6 addresses. There is no broadcast address in IPv6. Loopback and link-local are specific types of unicast addresses.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What are three parts of an IPv6 global unicast address? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>an interface ID that is used to identify the local network for a particular host</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a global routing prefix that is used to identify the network portion of the address that has been provided by an ISP *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a subnet ID that is used to identify networks inside of the local enterprise site*</strong></span></li>
<li>a global routing prefix that is used to identify the portion of the network address provided by a local administrator</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>an interface ID that is used to identify the local host on the network*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
There are three elements that make up an IPv6 global unicast address. A global routing prefix which is provided by an ISP, a subnet ID which is determined by the organization, and an interface ID which uniquely identifies the interface interface of a host.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>An administrator wants to configure hosts to automatically assign IPv6 addresses to themselves by the use of Router Advertisement messages, but also to obtain the DNS server address from a DHCPv6 server. Which address assignment method should be configured?</strong>
<ul>
<li>SLAAC</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>stateless DHCPv6*</strong></span></li>
<li>stateful DHCPv6</li>
<li>RA and EUI-64</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Stateless DHCPv6 allows clients to use ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages to automatically assign IPv6 addresses to themselves, but then allows these clients to contact a DHCPv6 server to obtain additional information such as the domain name and address of DNS servers. SLAAC does not allow the client to obtain additional information through DHCPv6, and stateful DHCPv6 requires that the client receive its interface address directly from a DHCPv6 server. RA messages, when combined with an EUI-64 interface identifier, are used to automatically create an interface IPv6 address, and are part of both SLAAC and stateless DHCPv6.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which protocol supports Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for dynamic assignment of IPv6 addresses to a host?</strong>
<ul>
<li>ARPv6</li>
<li>DHCPv6</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ICMPv6*</strong></span></li>
<li>UDP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
SLAAC uses ICMPv6 messages when dynamically assigning an IPv6 address to a host. DHCPv6 is an alternate method of assigning an IPv6 addresses to a host. ARPv6 does not exist. Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) provides the functionality of ARP for IPv6 networks. UDP is the transport layer protocol used by DHCPv6.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which two things can be determined by using the ping command? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>the number of routers between the source and destination device</li>
<li>the IP address of the router nearest the destination device</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the average time it takes a packet to reach the destination and for the response to return to the source *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the destination device is reachable through the network*</strong></span></li>
<li>the average time it takes each router in the path between source and destination to respond</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A ping command provides feedback on the time between when an echo request was sent to a remote host and when the echo reply was received. This can be a measure of network performance. A successful ping also indicates that the destination host was reachable through the network.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the purpose of ICMP messages?</strong>
<ul>
<li>to inform routers about network topology changes</li>
<li>to ensure the delivery of an IP packet</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to provide feedback of IP packet transmissions*</strong></span></li>
<li>to monitor the process of a domain name to IP address resolution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The purpose of ICMP messages is to provide feedback about issues that are related to the processing of IP packets.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is indicated by a successful ping to the ::1 IPv6 address?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The host is cabled properly.</li>
<li>The default gateway address is correctly configured.</li>
<li>All hosts on the local link are available.</li>
<li>The link-local address is correctly configured.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IP is properly installed on the host.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The IPv6 address ::1 is the loopback address. A successful ping to this address means that the TCP/IP stack is correctly installed. It does not mean that any addresses are correctly configured.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A user is executing a tracert to a remote device. At what point would a router, which is in the path to the destination device, stop forwarding the packet?</strong>
<ul>
<li>when the router receives an ICMP Time Exceeded message</li>
<li>when the RTT value reaches zero</li>
<li>when the host responds with an ICMP Echo Reply message</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>when the value in the TTL field reaches zero*</strong></span></li>
<li>when the values of both the Echo Request and Echo Reply messages reach zero</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a router receives a traceroute packet, the value in the TTL field is decremented by 1. When the value in the field reaches zero, the receiving router will not forward the packet, and will send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.<br />

<div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
ICMPv6 sends a Time Exceeded message if the router cannot forward an IPv6 packet because the packet expired. The router uses a hop limit field to determine if the packet has expired, and does not have a TTL field.<br />

The binary equivalent of the decimal number 232 is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>11101000</strong></span><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
To convert a decimal number to binary, first determine if the decimal number is equal to or greater than 128. In this case, because 232 is larger than 128, a 1 is placed in the bit position for decimal value 128 and the value of 128 is then subtracted from 232. This results in the value of 104. We then compare this value to 64. As 104 is larger than 64, a 1 is placed in the bit position for the decimal value 64 and the value of 64 is subtracted from 104. The remaining value is then 40. The process should be continued for all the remaining bit positions.​<br />

A router is used to route traffic between different networks. Broadcast traffic is not permitted to cross the router and therefore will be contained within the respective subnets where it originated.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What are two reasons a network administrator might want to create subnets? (Choose two.)</strong>

<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Two reasons for creating subnets include reduction of overall network traffic and improvement of network performance. Subnets also allow an administrator to implement subnet-based security policies. The number of routers or switches is not affected. Subnets do not simplify network design.<br />

<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A mask of 255.255.252.0 is equal to a prefix of /22. A /22 prefix provides 22 bits for the network portion and leaves 10 bits for the host portion. The 10 bits in the host portion will provide 1022 usable IP addresses (2^10 – 2 = 1022).<br />

The network IP address 192.168.5.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224 provides 30 usable IP addresses for each subnet. Subnet A needs 30 host addresses. There are no addresses wasted. Subnet B uses 2 of the 30 available IP addresses, because it is a serial link. Consequently, it wastes 28 addresses. Likewise, subnet C wastes 28 addresses. Subnet D needs 14 addresses, so it wastes 16 addresses. The total wasted addresses are 0+28+28+16=72 addresses.<br />

<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When monitoring servers, a network administrator needs to be able to quickly identify them. Using a predictable static addressing scheme for these devices makes them easier to identify. Server security, redundancy, and duplication of addresses are not features of an IP addressing scheme.<br />

<li><strong>Which two reasons generally make DHCP the preferred method of assigning IP addresses to hosts on large networks? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It eliminates most address configuration errors.*</strong></span></li>
<li>It ensures that addresses are only applied to devices that require a permanent address.</li>
<li>It guarantees that every device that needs an address will get one.</li>
<li>It provides an address only to devices that are authorized to be connected to the network.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It reduces the burden on network support staff.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
DHCP is generally the preferred method of assigning IP addresses to hosts on large networks because it reduces the burden on network support staff and virtually eliminates entry errors. However, DHCP itself does not discriminate between authorized and unauthorized devices and will assign configuration parameters to all requesting devices. DHCP servers are usually configured to assign addresses from a subnet range, so there is no guarantee that every device that needs an address will get one.<br />

<li><strong>A DHCP server is used to assign IP addresses dynamically to the hosts on a network. The address pool is configured with 192.168.10.0/24.

If the block of addresses allocated to the pool is 192.168.10.0/24, there are 254 IP addresses to be assigned to hosts on the network. As there are 3 printers which need to have their addresses assigned statically, then there are 251 IP addresses left for assignment.<br />

<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The network portion, or prefix, of an IPv6 address is identified through the prefix length. A /64 prefix length indicates that the first 64 bits of the IPv6 address is the network portion. Hence the prefix is 2001:DB8:BC15:A.<br />

<li><strong>Which two characteristics are associated with UDP sessions? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Destination devices receive traffic with minimal delay.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Transmitted data segments are tracked.</li>
<li>Destination devices reassemble messages and pass them to an application.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Received data is unacknowledged.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Unacknowledged data packets are retransmitted.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
TCP:<br />
· Provides tracking of transmitted data segments<br />
· Destination devices will acknowledge received data.<br />
· Source devices will retransmit unacknowledged data.</p>
<p>UDP<br />
· Destination devices will not acknowledge received data<br />
· Headers use very little overhead and cause minimal delay.​<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What happens if part of an FTP message is not delivered to the destination?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The message is lost because FTP does not use a reliable delivery method.</li>
<li>The FTP source host sends a query to the destination host.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The part of the FTP message that was lost is re-sent.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The entire FTP message is re-sent.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Because FTP uses TCP as its transport layer protocol, sequence and acknowledgment numbers will identify the missing segments, which will be re-sent to complete the message.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>A host device needs to send a large video file across the network while providing data communication to other users. Which feature will allow different communication streams to occur at the same time, without having a single data stream using all available bandwidth?</strong>
<ul>
<li>window size</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>multiplexing*</strong></span></li>
<li>port numbers</li>
<li>acknowledgments</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Multiplexing is useful for interleaving multiple communication streams. Window size is used to slow down the rate of data communication. Port numbers are used to pass data streams to their proper applications. Acknowledgments are used to notify a sending device that a stream of data packets has or has not been received.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What kind of port must be requested from IANA in order to be used with a specific application?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>registered port*</strong></span></li>
<li>private port</li>
<li>dynamic port</li>
<li>source port</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Registered ports (numbers 1024 to 49151) are assigned by IANA to a requesting entity to use with specific processes or applications. These processes are primarily individual applications that a user has chosen to install, rather than common applications that would receive a well-known port number. For example, Cisco has registered port 1985 for its Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP) process.​<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What type of information is included in the transport header?</strong>
<ul>
<li>destination and source logical addresses</li>
<li>destination and source physical addresses</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>destination and source port numbers*</strong></span></li>
<li>encoded application data</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In a segment, the transport layer header will include the source and destination process, or port numbers. Destination and source physical addressing is included in the frame header. Destination and source logical addressing is included in the network header. Application data is encoded in the upper layers of the protocol stack.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is a socket?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the combination of the source and destination IP address and source and destination Ethernet address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the combination of a source IP address and port number or a destination IP address and port number*</strong></span></li>
<li>the combination of the source and destination sequence and acknowledgment numbers</li>
<li>the combination of the source and destination sequence numbers and port numbers</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A socket is a combination of the source IP address and source port or the destination IP address and the destination port number.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is the complete range of TCP and UDP well-known ports?</strong>
<ul>
<li>0 to 255</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>0 to 1023*</strong></span></li>
<li>256 – 1023</li>
<li>1024 – 49151</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
There are three ranges of TCP and UDP ports. The well-know range of port numbers is from 0 &#8211; 1023.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which flag in the TCP header is used in response to a received FIN in order to terminate connectivity between two network devices?</strong>
<ul>
<li>FIN</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ACK*</strong></span></li>
<li>SYN</li>
<li>RST</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In a TCP session, when a device has no more data to send, it will send a segment with the FIN flag set. The connected device that receives the segment will respond with an ACK to acknowledge that segment. The device that sent the ACK will then send a FIN message to close the connection it has with the other device. The sending of the FIN should be followed with the receipt of an ACK from the other device.​<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is a characteristic of a TCP server process?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every application process running on the server has to be configured to use a dynamic port number.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There can be many ports open simultaneously on a server, one for each active server application.*</strong></span></li>
<li>An individual server can have two services assigned to the same port number within the same transport layer services.</li>
<li>A host running two different applications can have both configured to use the same server port.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Each application process running on the server is configured to use a port number, either by default or manually, by a system administrator. An individual server cannot have two services assigned to the same port number within the same transport layer services. A host running a web server application and a file transfer application cannot have both configured to use the same server port. There can be many ports open simultaneously on a server, one for each active server application.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which two flags in the TCP header are used in a TCP three-way handshake to establish connectivity between two network devices? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> ACK*</strong></span></li>
<li>FIN</li>
<li>PSH</li>
<li>RST</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SYN*</strong></span></li>
<li>URG</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
TCP uses the SYN and ACK flags in order to establish connectivity between two network devices.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>A PC is downloading a large file from a server. The TCP window is 1000 bytes. The server is sending the file using 100-byte segments. How many segments will the server send before it requires an acknowledgment from the PC?</strong>
<ul>
<li>1 segment</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>10 segments*</strong></span></li>
<li>100 segments</li>
<li>1000 segments</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
With a window of 1000 bytes, the destination host accepts segments until all 1000 bytes of data have been received. Then the destination host sends an acknowledgment.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which factor determines TCP window size?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the amount of data to be transmitted</li>
<li>the number of services included in the TCP segment</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the amount of data the destination can process at one time*</strong></span></li>
<li>the amount of data the source is capable of sending at one time</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Window is the number of bytes that the sender will send prior to expecting an acknowledgement from the destination device. The initial window is agreed upon during the session startup via the three-way handshake between source and destination. It is determined by how much data the destination device of a TCP session is able to accept and process at one time.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>During a TCP session, a destination device sends an acknowledgment number to the source device. What does the acknowledgment number represent?</strong>
<ul>
<li>the total number of bytes that have been received</li>
<li>one number more than the sequence number</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the next byte that the destination expects to receive*</strong></span></li>
<li>the last sequence number that was sent by the source</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What information is used by TCP to reassemble and reorder received segments?</strong>
<ul>
<li>port numbers</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>sequence numbers*</strong></span></li>
<li>acknowledgment numbers</li>
<li>fragment numbers</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
At the transport layer, TCP uses the sequence numbers in the header of each TCP segment to reassemble the segments into the correct order.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What does TCP do if the sending source detects network congestion on the path to the destination?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The source host will send a request for more frequent acknowledgments to the destination.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The source will decrease the amount of data that it sends before it must receive acknowledgements from the destination.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The destination will request retransmission of the entire message.</li>
<li>The source will acknowledge the last segment that is sent and include a request for a smaller window size in the message.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
If the source determines that TCP segments are either not being acknowledged or not acknowledged in a timely manner, then it can reduce the number of bytes it sends before receiving an acknowledgment. Notice that it is the source that is reducing the number of unacknowledged bytes it sends. This does not involve changing the window size in the segment header.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What is a characteristic of UDP?</strong>
<ul>
<li>UDP datagrams take the same path and arrive in the correct order at the destination.</li>
<li>Applications that use UDP are always considered unreliable.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UDP reassembles the received datagrams in the order they were received.*</strong></span></li>
<li>UDP only passes data to the network when the destination is ready to receive the data.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
UDP has no way to reorder the datagrams into their transmission order, so UDP simply reassembles the data in the order it was received and forwards it to the application.​<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What does a client do when it has UDP datagrams to send?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It just sends the datagrams.*</strong></span></li>
<li>It queries the server to see if it is ready to receive data.</li>
<li>It sends a simplified three-way handshake to the server.</li>
<li>It sends to the server a segment with the SYN flag set to synchronize the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a client has UDP datagrams to send, it just sends the datagrams.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>What happens if the first packet of a TFTP transfer is lost?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The client will wait indefinitely for the reply.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The TFTP application will retry the request if a reply is not received.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The next-hop router or the default gateway will provide a reply with an error code.</li>
<li>The transport layer will retry the query if a reply is not received.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The TFTP protocol uses UDP for queries, so the TFTP application must implement the reliability, if needed.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>A host device is receiving live streaming video. How does the device account for video data that is lost during transmission?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The device will immediately request a retransmission of the missing data.</li>
<li>The device will use sequence numbers to pause the video stream until the correct data arrives.</li>
<li>The device will delay the streaming video until the entire video stream is received.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The device will continue receiving the streaming video, but there may be a momentary disruption.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When TCP is used as the transport protocol, data must be received in a specific sequence or all data must be fully received in order for it to be used. TCP will use sequence numbers, acknowledgments and retransmission to accomplish this. However, when UDP is used as the transport protocol, data that arrives out of order or with missing segments may cause a momentary disruption, but the destination device may still be able to use the data that it has received. This technology results in the least amount of network delay by providing minimal reliability. Since live streaming video applications use UDP as the transport protocol, the receiver will continue showing the video although there may be a slight delay or reduction in quality.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Why does HTTP use TCP as the transport layer protocol?</strong>
<ul>
<li>to ensure the fastest possible download speed</li>
<li>because HTTP is a best-effort protocol</li>
<li>because transmission errors can be tolerated easily</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>because HTTP requires reliable delivery*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a host requests a web page, transmission reliability and completeness must be guaranteed. Therefore, HTTP uses TCP as its transport layer protocol.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>When is UDP preferred to TCP?</strong>
<ul>
<li>when a client sends a segment to a server</li>
<li>when all the data must be fully received before any part of it is considered useful</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>when an application can tolerate some loss of data during transmission*</strong></span></li>
<li>when segments must arrive in a very specific sequence to be processed successfully</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
UDP can be used when an application can tolerate some data loss. UDP is the preferred protocol for applications that provide voice or video that cannot tolerate delay.<br />
</p></div></li>
<li><strong>Which three application layer protocols use TCP? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SMTP*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>FTP*</strong></span></li>
<li>SNMP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>HTTP*</strong></span></li>
<li>TFTP</li>
<li>DHCP</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Some protocols require the reliable data transport that is provided by TCP. In addition, these protocols do not have real time communication requirements and can tolerate some data loss while minimizing protocol overhead. Examples of these protocols are SMTP, FTP, and HTTP.<br />
</p></div></li>

<strong>source port number -&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">2578</span></strong><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A TCP/IP segment that originated on the PC has 192.168.1.2 as the IP source address. 2578 is the only possible option for the source port number because the PC port number must be in the range of registered ports 1024 to 49151. The destination is the web server, which has the IP address 192.168.2.2, and the destination port number is 80 according to the HTTP protocol standard.<br />

<li><strong>A manufacturing company subscribes to certain hosted services from its ISP. The services that are required include hosted world wide web, file transfer, and e-mail. Which protocols represent these three key applications? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>FTP*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>HTTP*</strong></span></li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>SNMP</li>
<li>DHCP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SMTP*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The ISP uses the HTTP protocol in conjunction with hosting web pages, the FTP protocol with file transfers, and SMTP with e-mail. DNS is used to translate domain names to IP addresses. SNMP is used for network management traffic. DHCP ic commonly used to manage IP addressing.<br />
</p></div></li>

<li><strong>What is an example of network communication that uses the client-server model?</strong>
<ul>
<li>A user uses eMule to download a file that is shared by a friend after the file location is determined.</li>
<li>A workstation initiates an ARP to find the MAC address of a receiving host.</li>
<li>A user prints a document by using a printer that is attached to a workstation of a coworker.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A workstation initiates a DNS request when the user types www.cisco.com in the address bar of a web browser.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a user types a domain name of a website into the address bar of a web browser, a workstation needs to send a DNS request to the DNS server for the name resolution process. This request is a client/server model application. The eMule application is P2P. Sharing a printer on a workstation is a peer-to-peer network. Using ARP is just a broadcast message sent by a host.<br />

<li><strong>Two students are working on a network design project. One student is doing the drawing, while the other student is writing the proposal. The drawing is finished and the student wants to share the folder that contains the drawing so that the other student can access the file and copy it to a USB drive. Which networking model is being used?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> peer-to-peer*</strong></span></li>
<li>client-based</li>
<li>master-slave</li>
<li>point-to-point</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In a peer-to-peer (P2P) networking model, data is exchanged between two network devices without the use of a dedicated server. ​​<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What do the client/server and peer-to-peer network models have in common?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both models have dedicated servers.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Both models support devices in server and client roles.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Both models require the use of TCP/IP-based protocols.</li>
<li>Both models are used only in the wired network environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In both the client/server and peer-to-peer network models, clients and servers exist. In peer-to-peer networks, no dedicated server exists, but a device can assume the server role to provide information to a device serving in the client role.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is an advantage for small organizations of adopting IMAP instead of POP?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Messages are kept in the mail servers until they are manually deleted from the email client.*</strong></span></li>
<li>When the user connects to a POP server, copies of the messages are kept in the mail server for a short time, but IMAP keeps them for a long time.</li>
<li>IMAP sends and retrieves email, but POP only retrieves email.</li>
<li>POP only allows the client to store messages in a centralized way, while IMAP allows distributed storage.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
IMAP and POP are protocols that are used to retrieve email messages. The advantage of using IMAP instead of POP is that when the user connects to an IMAP-capable server, copies of the messages are downloaded to the client application. IMAP then stores the email messages on the server until the user manually deletes those messages.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which application layer protocol uses message types such as GET, PUT, and POST?</strong>
<ul>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>DHCP</li>
<li>SMTP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>HTTP*</strong></span></li>
<li>POP3</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The GET command is a client request for data from a web server. A PUT command uploads resources and content, such as images, to a web server. A POST command uploads data files to a web server.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>When retrieving email messages, which protocol allows for easy, centralized storage and backup of emails that would be desirable for a small- to medium-sized business?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IMAP*</strong></span></li>
<li>POP</li>
<li>SMTP</li>
<li>HTTPS</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
IMAP is preferred for small-to medium-sized businesses as IMAP allows centralized storage and backup of emails, with copies of the emails being forwarded to clients. POP delivers the emails to the clients and deletes them on the email server. SMTP is used to send emails and not to receive them. HTTPS is not used for secure web browsing.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the function of the Nslookup utility?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to manually query the name servers to resolve a given host name*</strong></span></li>

<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong>HTTPS is a secure form of HTTP used to access web content hosted by a web server.</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which three statements describe a DHCP Discover message? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>The source MAC address is 48 ones (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF).</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The destination IP address is 255.255.255.255.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The message comes from a server offering an IP address.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The message comes from a client seeking an IP address.*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>All hosts receive the message, but only a DHCP server replies.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Only the DHCP server receives the message.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a host configured to use DHCP powers up on a network it sends a DHCPDISCOVER message. FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF is the L2 broadcast address. A DHCP server replies with a unicast DHCPOFFER message back to the host.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What part of the URL, http://www.cisco.com/index.html, represents the top-level DNS domain?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.com*</strong></span></li>
<li>www</li>
<li>http</li>
<li>index</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The components of the URL http://www.cisco.com/index.htm are as follows:<br />
http = protocol<br />
www = part of the server name<br />
cisco = part of the domain name<br />
index = file name<br />
com = the top-level domain<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which two tasks can be performed by a local DNS server? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>providing IP addresses to local hosts</li>
<li>allowing data transfer between two network devices</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>mapping name-to-IP addresses for internal hosts*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>forwarding name resolution requests between servers*</strong></span></li>
<li>retrieving email messages</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Two important functions of DNS are to (1) provide IP addresses for domain names such as www.cisco.com, and (2) forward requests that cannot be resolved to other servers in order to provide domain name to IP address translation. DHCP provides IP addressing information to local devices. A file transfer protocol such as FTP, SFTP, or TFTP provides file sharing services. IMAP or POP can be used to retrieve an email message from a server.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which phrase describes an FTP daemon?</strong>
<ul>
<li>a diagnostic FTP program</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a program that is running on an FTP server*</strong></span></li>
<li>a program that is running on an FTP client</li>
<li>an application that is used to request data from an FTP server</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
An FTP server runs an FTP daemon, which is a program that provides FTP services. End users who request services must run an FTP client program.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which statement is true about FTP?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The client can choose if FTP is going to establish one or two connections with the server.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The client can download data from or upload data to the server.*</strong></span></li>
<li>FTP is a peer-to-peer application.</li>
<li>FTP does not provide reliability during data transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
FTP is a client/server protocol. FTP requires two connections between the client and the server and uses TCP to provide reliable connections. With FTP, data transfer can happen in either direction. The client can download (pull) data from the server or upload (push) data to the server.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is true about the Server Message Block protocol?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Different SMB message types have a different format.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Clients establish a long term connection to servers.*</strong></span></li>
<li>SMB messages cannot authenticate a session.</li>
<li>SMB uses the FTP protocol for communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The Server Message Block protocol is a protocol for file, printer, and directory sharing. Clients establish a long term connection to servers and when the connection is active, the resources can be accessed. Every SMB message has the same format. The use of SMB differs from FTP mainly in the length of the sessions. SMB messages can authenticate sessions.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which application layer protocol is used to provide file-sharing and print services to Microsoft applications?</strong>
<ul>
<li>HTTP</li>

<li><strong>A newly hired network technician is given the task of ordering new hardware for a small business with a large growth forecast. Which primary factor should the technician be concerned with when choosing the new devices?</strong>
<ul>
<li>devices with a fixed number and type of interfaces</li>
<li>devices that have support for network monitoring</li>
<li>redundant devices</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>devices with support for modularity*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In a small business with a large growth forecast, the primary influencing factor would be the ability of devices to support modularity. Devices with a fixed type/number of interfaces would not support growth. Redundancy is an important factor, but typically found in large enterprises. Network monitoring is also an important consideration, but not as important as modularity.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which network design consideration would be more important to a large corporation than to a small business?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Internet router</li>
<li>firewall</li>
<li>low port density switch</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>redundancy*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Small businesses today do need Internet access and use an Internet router to provide this need. A switch is required to connect the two host devices and any IP phones or network devices such as a printer or a scanner. The switch may be integrated into the router. A firewall is needed to protect the business computing assets. Redundancy is not normally found in very small companies, but slightly larger small companies might use port density redundancy or have redundant Internet providers/links.<br />

<li><strong>Which two traffic types require delay sensitive delivery? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>email</li>
<li>web</li>
<li>FTP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>voice*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>video*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Voice and video traffic have delay sensitive characteristics and must be given priority over other traffic types such as web, email, and file transfer traffic.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A network administrator for a small company is contemplating how to scale the network over the next three years to accommodate projected growth. Which three types of information should be used to plan for network growth? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>human resource policies and procedures for all employees in the company</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>documentation of the current physical and logical topologies *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>analysis of the network traffic based on protocols, applications, and services used on the network*</strong></span></li>
<li>history and mission statement of the company</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>inventory of the devices that are currently used on the network*</strong></span></li>
<li>listing of the current employees and their role in the company</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Several elements that are needed to scale a network include documentation of the physical and logical topology, a list of devices that are used on the network, and an analysis of the traffic on the network.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which two statements describe how to assess traffic flow patterns and network traffic types using a protocol analyzer? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Capture traffic on the weekends when most employees are off work.</li>
<li>Only capture traffic in the areas of the network that receive most of the traffic such as the data center.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Capture traffic during peak utilization times to get a good representation of the different traffic types. *</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Perform the capture on different network segments.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Only capture WAN traffic because traffic to the web is responsible for the largest amount of traffic on a network.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Traffic flow patterns should be gathered during peak utilization times to get a good representation of the different traffic types. The capture should also be performed on different network segments because some traffic will be local to a particular segment.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Some routers and switches in a wiring closet malfunctioned after an air conditioning unit failed. What type of threat does this situation describe?</strong>
<ul>
<li>configuration</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>environmental*</strong></span></li>
<li>electrical</li>
<li>maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The four classes of threats are as follows:<br />
Hardware threats &#8211; physical damage to servers, routers, switches, cabling plant, and workstations<br />
Environmental threats &#8211; temperature extremes (too hot or too cold) or humidity extremes (too wet or too dry)<br />
Electrical threats &#8211; voltage spikes, insufficient supply voltage (brownouts), unconditioned power (noise), and total power loss<br />
Maintenance threats &#8211; poor handling of key electrical components (electrostatic discharge), lack of critical spare parts, poor cabling, and poor labeling<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which type of network threat is intended to prevent authorized users from accessing resources?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DoS attacks*</strong></span></li>
<li>access attacks</li>
<li>reconnaissance attacks</li>
<li>trust exploitation</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Network reconnaissance attacks involve the unauthorized discovery and mapping of the network and network systems. Access attacks and trust exploitation involve unauthorized manipulation of data and access to systems or user privileges. DoS, or Denial of Service attacks, are intended to prevent legitimate users and devices from accessing network resources.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which two actions can be taken to prevent a successful network attack on an email server account? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Never send the password through the network in a clear text.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Never use passwords that need the Shift key.</li>
<li>Use servers from different vendors.</li>
<li>Distribute servers throughout the building, placing them close to the stakeholders.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Limit the number of unsuccessful attempts to log in to the server.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
One of the most common types of access attack uses a packet sniffer to yield user accounts and passwords that are transmitted as clear text. Repeated attempts to log in to a server to gain unauthorized access constitute another type of access attack. Limiting the number of attempts to log in to the server and using encrypted passwords will help prevent successful logins through these types of access attack.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which firewall feature is used to ensure that packets coming into a network are legitimate responses initiated from internal hosts?</strong>
<ul>
<li>application filtering</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>stateful packet inspection*</strong></span></li>
<li>URL filtering</li>
<li>packet filtering</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Stateful packet inspection on a firewall checks that incoming packets are actually legitimate responses to requests originating from hosts inside the network. Packet filtering can be used to permit or deny access to resources based on IP or MAC address. Application filtering can permit or deny access based on port number. URL filtering is used to permit or deny access based on URL or on keywords.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the purpose of the network security authentication function?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to require users to prove who they are*</strong></span></li>
<li>to determine which resources a user can access</li>
<li>to keep track of the actions of a user</li>
<li>to provide challenge and response questions</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Authentication, authorization, and accounting are network services collectively known as AAA. Authentication requires users to prove who they are. Authorization determines which resources the user can access. Accounting keeps track of the actions of the user.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A network administrator is issuing the login block-for 180 attempts 2 within 30 command on a router. Which threat is the network administrator trying to prevent?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a user who is trying to guess a password to access the router*</strong></span></li>
<li>a worm that is attempting to access another part of the network</li>
<li>an unidentified individual who is trying to access the network equipment room</li>
<li>a device that is trying to inspect the traffic on a link</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The login block-for 180 attempts 2 within 30 command will cause the device to block authentication after 2 unsuccessful attempts within 30 seconds for a duration of 180 seconds. A device inspecting the traffic on a link has nothing to do with the router. The router configuration cannot prevent unauthorized access to the equipment room. A worm would not attempt to access the router to propagate to another part of the network.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which two steps are required before SSH can be enabled on a Cisco router? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Give the router a host name and domain name.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Create a banner that will be displayed to users when they connect.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Generate a set of secret keys to be used for encryption and decryption.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Set up an authentication server to handle incoming connection requests.</li>
<li>Enable SSH on the physical interfaces where the incoming connection requests will be received.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
There are four steps to configure SSH on a Cisco router. First, set the host name and domain name. Second, generate a set of RSA keys to be used for encrypting and decrypting the traffic. Third, create the user IDs and passwords of the users who will be connecting. Lastly, enable SSH on the vty lines on the router. SSH does not need to be set up on any physical interfaces, nor does an external authentication server need to be used. While it is a good idea to configure a banner to display legal information for connecting users, it is not required to enable SSH.​<br />

<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. Baseline documentation for a small company had ping round trip time statistics of 36/97/132 between hosts H1 and H3. Today the network administrator checked connectivity by pinging between hosts H1 and H3 that resulted in a round trip time of 1458/2390/6066. What does this indicate to the network administrator?</strong><br />
<img src="https://ccnav6.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/i208090v1n1_208088.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Connectivity between H1 and H3 is fine.</li>
<li>H3 is not connected properly to the network.</li>
<li>Something is causing interference between H1 and R1.</li>
<li>Performance between the networks is within expected parameters.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Something is causing a time delay between the networks.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Ping round trip time statistics are shown in milliseconds. The larger the number the more delay. A baseline is critical in times of slow performance. By looking at the documentation for the performance when the network is performing fine and comparing it to information when there is a problem, a network administrator can resolve problems faster.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>When should an administrator establish a network baseline?</strong>
<ul>
<li>when the traffic is at peak in the network</li>
<li>when there is a sudden drop in traffic</li>
<li>at the lowest point of traffic in the network</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>at regular intervals over a period of time*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
An effective network baseline can be established by monitoring the traffic at regular intervals. This allows the administrator to take note when any deviance from the established norm occurs in the network.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. An administrator is trying to troubleshoot connectivity between PC1 and PC2 and uses the tracert command from PC1 to do it. Based on the displayed output, where should the administrator begin troubleshooting?</strong><br />
<img src="https://ccnav6.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/i210352v1n3_210352-1.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>PC2</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>R1*</strong></span></li>
<li>SW2</li>
<li>R2</li>
<li>SW1</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Tracert is used to trace the path a packet takes. The only successful response was from the first device along the path on the same LAN as the sending host. The first device is the default gateway on router R1. The administrator should therefore start troubleshooting at R1.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which statement is true about CDP on a Cisco device?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The show cdp neighbor detail command will reveal the IP address of a neighbor only if there is Layer 3 connectivity.</li>
<li>To disable CDP globally, the no cdp enable command in interface configuration mode must be used.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>CDP can be disabled globally or on a specific interface.*</strong></span></li>
<li>Because it runs at the data link layer, the CDP protocol can only be implemented in switches.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
CDP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol that can be disabled globally by using the no cdp run global configuration command, or disabled on a specific interface, by using the no cdp enable interface configuration command. Because CDP operates at the data link layer, two or more Cisco network devices, such as routers can learn about each other even if Layer 3 connectivity does not exist. The show cdp neighbors detail command reveals the IP address of a neighboring device regardless of whether you can ping the neighbor.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A network administrator for a small campus network has issued the show ip interface brief command on a switch. What is the administrator verifying with this command?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the status of the switch interfaces and the address configured on interface vlan 1*</strong></span></li>
<li>that a specific host on another network can be reached</li>
<li>the path that is used to reach a specific host on another network</li>
<li>the default gateway that is used by the switch</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The show ip interface brief command is used to verify the status and IP address configuration of the physical and switch virtual interfaces (SVI).<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A network technician issues the arp -d * command on a PC after the router that is connected to the LAN is reconfigured. What is the result after this command is issued?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The ARP cache is cleared.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The current content of the ARP cache is displayed.</li>
<li>The detailed information of the ARP cache is displayed.</li>
<li>The ARP cache is synchronized with the router interface.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Issuing the arp –d * command on a PC will clear the ARP cache content. This is helpful when a network technician wants to ensure the cache is populated with updated information.<br />

<li><strong>A network technician issues the C:\&gt; tracert -6 www.cisco.com command on a Windows PC. What is the purpose of the -6 command option?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It forces the trace to use IPv6.*</strong></span></li>
<li>It limits the trace to only 6 hops.</li>
<li>It sets a 6 milliseconds timeout for each replay.</li>
<li>It sends 6 probes within each TTL time period.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The -6 option in the command C:\&gt; tracert -6 www.cisco.com is used to force the trace to use IPv6.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which command should be used on a Cisco router or switch to allow log messages to be displayed on remotely connected sessions using Telnet or SSH?</strong>
<ul>
<li>debug all</li>
<li>logging synchronous</li>
<li>show running-config​</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>terminal monitor*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The terminal monitor command is very important to use when log messages appear. Log messages appear by default when a user is directly consoled into a Cisco device, but require the terminal monitor command to be entered when a user is accessing a network device remotely.<br />

<li>extendednet</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The term Internet refers to the worldwide collection of connected networks. Intranet refers to a private connection of LANs and WANS that belong to an organization and is designed to be accessible to the members of the organization, employees, or others with authorization.​ Extranets provide secure and safe access to ​suppliers, customers, and collaborators. Extendednet is not a type of network.<br />

<li><strong>Refer to the exhibit. An administrator is trying to configure the switch but receives the error message that is displayed in the exhibit. What is the problem?</strong><br />
<img src="https://ccnav6.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/i208399v1n1_Question-1.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The entire command, configure terminal, must be used.</li>
<li>The administrator is already in global configuration mode.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The administrator must first enter privileged EXEC mode before issuing the command.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The administrator must connect via the console port to access global configuration mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In order to enter global configuration mode, the command configure terminal, or a shortened version such as config t, must be entered from privileged EXEC mode. In this scenario the administrator is in user EXEC mode, as indicated by the &gt; symbol after the hostname. The administrator would need to use the enable command to move into privileged EXEC mode before entering the configure terminal command.<br />

<li>Ctrl-Z</li>
<li>Ctrl-C</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The Cisco IOS provides both hot keys and shortcuts for configuring routers and switches. The Ctrl-Shift-6 hot key combination is used to interrupt an IOS process, such as a ping or traceroute. Ctrl-Z is used to exit the configuration mode. Ctrl-C aborts the current command. Ctrl-Shift-X has no IOS function.<br />

<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>linevtyin*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Telnet accesses a network device through the virtual interface configured with the line VTY command. The password configured under this is required to access the user EXEC mode. The password configured under the line console 0 command is required to gain entry through the console port, and the enable and enable secret passwords are used to allow entry into the privileged EXEC mode.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A network administrator enters the service password­encryption command into the configuration mode of a router. What does this command accomplish?</strong>
<ul>
<li>This command encrypts passwords as they are transmitted across serial WAN links.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This command prevents someone from viewing the running configuration passwords.*</strong></span></li>
<li>This command enables a strong encryption algorithm for the enable secret password command.</li>
<li>This command automatically encrypts passwords in configuration files that are currently stored in NVRAM.</li>
<li>This command provides an exclusive encrypted password for external service personnel who are required to do router maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is the purpose of the SVI on a Cisco switch?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The SVI provides a physical interface for remote access to the switch.</li>
<li>The SVI provides a faster method for switching traffic between ports on the switch.</li>
<li>The SVI adds Layer 4 connectivity between VLANs.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The SVI provides a virtual interface for remote access to the switch.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The SVI is a virtual, not physical, interface that provides remote access to the switch. It does not impact Layer 4 nor does it enhance switching between switch ports on the switch.<br />

<li><strong>Which message delivery option is used when all devices need to receive the same message simultaneously?</strong>
<ul>
<li>duplex</li>
<li>unicast</li>
<li>multicast</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>broadcast*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When all devices need to receive the same message simultaneously, the message would be delivered as a broadcast. Unicast delivery occurs when one source host sends a message to one destination host. The sending of the same message from a host to a group of destination hosts is multicast delivery. Duplex communications refers to the ability of the medium to carry messages in both directions.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Which two protocols function at the internet layer? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>POP</li>
<li>BOOTP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ICMP*</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IP*</strong></span></li>
<li>PPP</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
ICMP and IP both function at the internet layer, whereas PPP is a network access layer protocol, and POP and BOOTP are application layer protocols.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What PDU is associated with the transport layer?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>segment*</strong></span></li>
<li>packet</li>
<li>frame</li>
<li>bits</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The PDU for the transport layer is called a segment. Packets, frames, and bits are PDUs for the network, data link, and physical layers respectively.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What is done to an IP packet before it is transmitted over the physical medium?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is tagged with information guaranteeing reliable delivery.</li>
<li>It is segmented into smaller individual pieces.</li>
<li>It is encapsulated into a TCP segment.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is encapsulated in a Layer 2 frame.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When messages are sent on a network, the encapsulation process works from the top of the OSI or TCP/IP model to the bottom. At each layer of the model, the upper layer information is encapsulated into the data field of the next protocol. For example, before an IP packet can be sent, it is encapsulated in a data link frame at Layer 2 so that it can be sent over the physical medium.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What type of communication medium is used with a wireless LAN connection?</strong>
<ul>
<li>fiber</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>radio waves*</strong></span></li>
<li>microwave</li>
<li>UTP</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A wired LAN connection commonly uses UTP. A wireless LAN connection uses radio waves.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>In addition to the cable length, what two factors could interfere with the communication carried over UTP cables? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>crosstalk*</strong></span></li>
<li>bandwidth</li>
<li>size of the network</li>
<li>signal modulation technique</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>electromagnetic interference *</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Copper media is widely used in network communications. However, copper media is limited by distance and signal interference. Data is transmitted on copper cables as electrical pulses. The electrical pulses are susceptible to interference from two sources:<br />
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI) &#8211; EMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt the data signals being carried by copper media.<br />
Crosstalk &#8211; Crosstalk is a disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of a signal on one wire interfering with the signal in an adjacent wire.<br />

<li><strong>What are the two sublayers of the OSI model data link layer? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li>internet</li>
<li>physical</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LLC*</strong></span></li>
<li>transport</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>MAC*</strong></span></li>
<li>network access</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The data link layer of the OSI model is divided into two sublayers: the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>A technician has been asked to develop a physical topology for a network that provides a high level of redundancy. Which physical topology requires that every node is attached to every other node on the network?</strong>
<ul>
<li>bus</li>
<li>hierarchical</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>mesh*</strong></span></li>
<li>ring</li>
<li>star</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The mesh topology provides high availability because every node is connected to all other nodes. Mesh topologies can be found in WANs. A partial mesh topology can also be used where some, but not all, end points connect to one another.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What type of communication rule would best describe CSMA/CD?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>access method*</strong></span></li>
<li>flow control</li>
<li>message encapsulation</li>
<li>message encoding</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Carrier sense multiple access collision detection (CSMA/CD) is the access method used with Ethernet. The access method rule of communication dictates how a network device is able to place a signal on the carrier. CSMA/CD dictates those rules on an Ethernet network and CSMA/CA dictates those rules on an 802.11 wireless LAN.</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>If data is being sent over a wireless network, then connects to an Ethernet network, and eventually connects to a DSL connection, which header will be replaced each time the data travels through a network infrastructure device?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Layer 3</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>data link*</strong></span></li>
<li>physical</li>
<li>Layer 4</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Because each data link layer protocol controls how the device accesses the media, the data link information must be removed and re-attached. Even if a packet is going from one Ethernet network to another Ethernet network, the data link layer information is replaced.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What best describes the destination IPv4 address that is used by multicasting?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a single IP multicast address that is used by all destinations in a group*</strong></span></li>
<li>an IP address that is unique for each destination in the group</li>
<li>a group address that shares the last 23 bits with the source IPv4 address</li>
<li>a 48 bit address that is determined by the number of members in the multicast group</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The destination multicast IPv4 address is a group address, which is a single IP multicast address within the Class D range.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>In an Ethernet network, when a device receives a frame of 1200 bytes, what will it do?</strong>
<ul>
<li>drop the frame</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>process the frame as it is*</strong></span></li>
<li>send an error message to the sending device</li>
<li>add random data bytes to make the frame 1518 bytes long and then forward it</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Ethernet standards define the minimum frame as 64 bytes and a maximum of 1518 bytes. A frame less than 64 bytes is considered a &#8220;collision fragment&#8221; or &#8220;runt frame&#8221; and is automatically discarded by receiving devices. A frame greater than 1500 is considered a &#8220;baby giant&#8221;. A 1200 byte frame is within the normal range so it would be processed as is.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What important information is examined in the Ethernet frame header by a Layer 2 device in order to forward the data onward?</strong>
<ul>
<li>source MAC address</li>
<li>source IP address</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>destination MAC address*</strong></span></li>
<li>Ethernet type</li>
<li>destination IP address</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The Layer 2 device, such as a switch, uses the destination MAC address to determine which path (interface or port) should be used to send the data onward to the destination device.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What will a Layer 2 switch do when the destination MAC address of a received frame is not in the MAC table?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It initiates an ARP request.</li>
<li>It broadcasts the frame out of all ports on the switch.</li>
<li>It notifies the sending host that the frame cannot be delivered.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It forwards the frame out of all ports except for the port at which the frame was received.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A Layer 2 switch determines how to handle incoming frames by using its MAC address table. When an incoming frame contains a destination MAC address that is not in the table, the switch forwards the frame out all ports, except for the port on which it was received.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>What are two features of ARP? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If a host is ready to send a packet to a local destination device and it has the IP address but not the MAC address of the destination, it generates an ARP broadcast.*</strong></span></li>
<li>An ARP request is sent to all devices on the Ethernet LAN and contains the IP address of the destination host and its multicast MAC address.</li>
<li>When a host is encapsulating a packet into a frame, it refers to the MAC address table to determine the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses.</li>
<li>If no device responds to the ARP request, then the originating node will broadcast the data packet to all devices on the network segment.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If a device receiving an ARP request has the destination IPv4 address, it responds with an ARP reply.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
When a node encapsulates a data packet into a frame, it needs the destination MAC address. First it determines if the destination device is on the local network or on a remote network. Then it checks the ARP table (not the MAC table) to see if a pair of IP address and MAC address exists for either the destination IP address (if the destination host is on the local network) or the default gateway IP address (if the destination host is on a remote network). If the match does not exist, it generates an ARP broadcast to seek the IP address to MAC address resolution. Because the destination MAC address is unknown, the ARP request is broadcast with the MAC address FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. Either the destination device or the default gateway will respond with its MAC address, which enables the sending node to assemble the frame. If no device responds to the ARP request, then the originating node will discard the packet because a frame cannot be created.<br />

<li><strong>Which two services are required to enable a computer to receive dynamic IP addresses and access the Internet using domain names? (Choose two.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DNS*</strong></span></li>
<li>WINS</li>
<li>HTTP</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DHCP*</strong></span></li>

<p></p>
<li><strong>What is a basic characteristic of the IP protocol?</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>connectionless*</strong></span></li>
<li>media dependent</li>
<li>user data segmentation</li>
<li>reliable end-to-end delivery</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol that does not require initial exchange of control information to establish an end-to-end connection before packets are forwarded. Thus, IP is connectionless and does not provide reliable end-to-end delivery by itself. IP is media independent. User data segmentation is a service provided at the transport layer.<br />

</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In the IPv6 address scheme, the network of fe80::/10 is reserved for link-local addresses. The address fe80::/64 is a network address that indicates, in this workstation, fe80::/64 is actually used for link-local addresses. Thus the address fe80::30d0:115:3f57:fe4c/128 is a valid IPv6 link-local address.<br />

<li><strong>What is the usable number of host IP addresses on a network that has a /26 mask?</strong>
<ul>
<li>256</li>
<li>254</li>
<li>64</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>62*</strong></span></li>
<li>32</li>
<li>16</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
A /26 mask is the same as 255.255.255.192. The mask leaves 6 host bits. With 6 host bits, 64 IP addresses are possible. One address represents the subnet number and one address represents the broadcast address, which means that 62 addresses can then be used to assign to network devices.<br />
</p></div></li>

<li>172.16.23.255</li>
<li>172.16.255.255</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The 172.16.16.0/22 network has 22 bits in the network portion and 10 bits in the host portion. Converting the network address to binary yields a subnet mask of 255.255.252.0. The range of addresses in this network will end with the last address available before 172.16.20.0. Valid host addresses for this network range from 172.16.16.1-172.16.19.254, making 172.16.19.255 the broadcast address.<br />
</p></div></li>

<li><strong>A technician with a PC is using multiple applications while connected to the Internet. How is the PC able to keep track of the data flow between multiple application sessions and have each application receive the correct packet flows?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The data flow is being tracked based on the destination port number utilized by each application.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The data flow is being tracked based on the source port number utilized by each application.*</strong></span></li>
<li>The data flow is being tracked based on the source IP address used by the PC of the technician.</li>
<li>The data flow is being tracked based on the destination IP address used by the PC of the technician.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The source port number of an application is randomly generated and used to individually keep track of each session connecting out to the Internet. Each application will use a unique source port number to provide simultaneous communication from multiple applications through the Internet.<br />

<li><strong>What three services are provided by the transport layer? (Choose three.)</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>flow control*</strong></span></li>
<li>encryption of data</li>
<li>path determination</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>connection establishment *</strong></span></li>

<li>bit transmission</li>
<li>data representation</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The transport layer is responsible for tracking digital conversations between a source application and a destination application through the use of port numbers. Two protocols that operate at the transport layer are TCP and UDP. TCP can provide reliability by establishing a connection, maintaining flow control, and error recovery.<br />
</p></div></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>An Internet television transmission is using UDP. What happens when part of the transmission is not delivered to the destination?</strong>
<ul>
<li>A delivery failure message is sent to the source host.</li>
<li>The part of the television transmission that was lost is re-sent.</li>
<li>The entire transmission is re-sent.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The transmission continues without the missing portion.*</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
Most streaming services, such as Internet television, use UDP as the transport layer protocol. These transmissions can tolerate some transmission failures, and no failure messages or retransmissions are required. Such control measures would create noticeable disruption to the flow of data.<br />
</p></div></li>

<li>master</li>
<li>server</li>
<li>slave</li>
<li>transient</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
In the client/server network model, a network device assumes the role of server in order to provide a particular service such as file transfer and storage. The device requesting the service assumes the role of client. In the client/server network model, a dedicated server does not have to be used, but if one is present, the network model being used is the client/server model. In contrast, the peer-to-peer network model does not have a dedicated server.<br />

<li>All login attempts will be blocked for 90 seconds if there are 4 failed attempts within 150 seconds.</li>
<li>All login attempts will be blocked for 1.5 hours if there are 4 failed attempts within 150 seconds.</li>
<li>All login attempts will be blocked for 4 hours if there are 90 failed attempts within 150 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="message_box success"><p><strong>Explain:</strong><br />
The components of the login block-for 150 attempts 4 within 90 command are as follows:<br />
The expression block-for 150 is the time in seconds that logins will be blocked.<br />
The expression attempts 4 is the number of failed attempts that will trigger the blocking of login requests.<br />
